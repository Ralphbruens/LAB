Its intended as a 'Do-It -Yourself' Pirate's Handbook, aimed at promoting neighbourhood, political and openaccess radio pirates. This version is updated with modern technologies and made to preserve the pirate radio ideas.
... But obviously you can use it as you wish ... , you can play your favourite music, or you can set up local open-access stations.

    <div> <p class='update'> Apache can serve HTML files over HTTP, and with additional modules can serve dynamic web pages using scripting languages such as PHP.</
    First, update the available packages by typing the following command into the Terminal: sudo apt update
  <br> Then, install the apache2 package with this command: sudo apt install apache2 -y
      <br>
      <br>
      By default, Apache puts a test HTML file in the web folder. This default web page is served when you browse to http://localhost/ on the Pi itself, or http://192.168.1.10 (whatever the Pi's IP address is) from another computer on the network. To find the Pi's IP address, type hostname -I at the command line
<br>
<br>
This default web page is just an HTML file on the filesystem. It is located at /var/www/html/index.html.
Navigate to this directory in a terminal window and have a look at what's inside:
<br>
cd /var/www/html
ls -al
</p>
<div class="filtered">
  <img src="img/serveronline_05.png">
</div>
<p class='update'>
This shows that by default there is one file in /var/www/html/ called index.htmland it is owned by the root user (as is the enclosing folder). In order to edit the file, you need to change its ownership to your own username. Change the owner of the file (the default pi user is assumed here) using sudo chown pi: index.html.

You can now try editing this file and then refreshing the browser to see the web page change.
<br>
<br>
If you know HTML you can put your own HTML files and other assets in this directory and serve them as a website on your local network.
Make sure there is a File called SSH on your SD card to acces your server with cyberduck.

  <div> <p class='date'> <span class='highlight2'>FM Radio with Raspberry Pi</span></p>  </div>
  <p class='update'>
  Materials: Raspberry Pi + SD Card, Wire
Use the tiny computer to create and broadcast the signal, and attach an antenna to give it the broadcast range.
<br>
<br>
<div class="filtered">

</p>
  <p class='update'>
1. Set up your Raspberry Pi
You’ll need to get Raspbian, the Linux-based operating system for the
<br>
<br>
2. Install the FM radio software
Once your Pi is up and running, you’ll need software. Specifically, PiFM
<br>
<br>
3. Get your (pre-recorded)tracks set and copy them over to the Raspberry Pi.
If you’re using the base PiFM software, you’ll need 16-bit .wav files.
<br>
<br>
4. Add an antenna
Plug a strip of wire into the GPIO4 pin on your Raspberry Pi (the fourth pin down on the left side on most Pi hardware).
<br>
<br>
5. Broadcast
Run the PiFM code. You’ll do that by running a command like “sudo ./pifm awesomejams.wav 100.0”, where that “100.0” is the frequency in MHz on which you’re broadcasting.

<div> <p class='date'> <span class='highlight2'>LAB Tie-dye socks</span></p>  </div>
<p class='update'>
Materials: White (sport)sock, Purple textile paint, Water, Salt, Platic bag, Rubber glooves, Elastic
<br>
<br>

</p>
<p class='update'>
1. Dissolve the fabric paint in warm water according to the instructions on the package.
Although the instructions depend on the brand and the chemicals that are in the paint (In this tutorial we use Dylon), as a general guideline you can keep mixing 2 teaspoons of paint with 1 tablespoon of salt and 250 ml of warm to hot water. Mix it well to make a concentrated dye bath
<br>
<br>
2. Transfer each concentrated dye solution into an empty squeeze bottle, like the kind used for condiments. These bottles can be bought at most grocery stores and general retailers.[2]
You could also transfer the dye into small bowl or buckets and dip-dye your socks instead of squirt-dying them.
Dip dying works especially well if you only plan on using one or two colors.
<br>
<br>
3. Choose clean, white, cotton socks. Wash your socks as you would normally before you tie dye them. Cotton holds dye the most effectively, so the socks you choose should be at least 80 percent cotton. Spandex and polyester will not dye.
You need to use white socks in order to get the brightest and most visible dye color.
<br>
<br>
4. Combine salt and water. But first, put on some rubber gloves. Use a long-handled wooden spoon to mix roughly ¾ cup (177 ml) of the soda ash and 1 gallon (3.8 L) of warm water in a large bucket.
<br>
<br>
5. Soak your socks uncovered in the solution for at least 5 minutes. You can soak your socks in the soda ash solution for up to an hour or so. However, once the fabric is removed, it should be dyed within 30 minutes of the soda ash treatment.
<br>
<br>
6. Tie your socks off. Use rubber bands to tie off sections of your socks so that the dye will create patterns. Tying rubber bands in various ways will yield different designs in the tie dye. Common rubber band patterns include
<br>
Extra: Stripes, made by wrapping three to four rubber bands around the foot of the sock and along the leg of the sock as well.
Spirals, made by gathering the fabric into a twist and then fastening the twist with rubber bands.
Circles, made by pinching off a section of the material and tying it off about 1 inch (2.5 cm) down with a single rubber band. This works well for heels.
Ring patterns, made by slipping buttons or pennies into the socks. Tie these off with rubber bands to hold the button or penny when dyeing.
<br>
<br>
7. Apply the dye. Lay the tied-off socks flat on your work surface. Squirt the dye onto your socks using your squirt bottles. Apply the dye around the tied-off portions of the material. Use the nozzle of the bottle to direct dye into the fabric folds
<br>
<br>
8. Place the socks in plastic bags. Seal the socks in plastic bags and let them sit in a warm area for 24 hours. A warm temperature will bring out a vibrant color in the dye. When you remove the socks from the bag the following day, the bag should be steamy and warm inside.
<br>
</p>
<div class="filtered">
  <img src="img/Socks1.jpg">
</div>

<br>
<p class='update'> 9. Rinse the socks in cool water. After the dye has set, remove the socks from the bag and strip away the rubber bands, buttons, and pennies. Place the socks under cool running tap water and rinse them until the water runs clear.
Let the socks dry!
<br>
<br>
10. Wash the socks in cold water. After rinsing the socks, wash them separately in your washing machine using cold water and regular detergent. This will help lock the dye into the fibers of the fabric so the colors last longer.
<br>
Extra: You could use an mixure of lukwarm water, vinegar and salt to lock the color of the socks.
<br>
<br>
Wash your socks separately a few times before throwing them in with other other clothes to prevent the dye from running.
